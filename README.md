# Congratulator

&nbsp; &nbsp; This project is nothing but a **Telegram Bot** that fetches the data from **Google Spreadsheet** though the API, interprets obtained data, does straightforward analisys and provide the statistics/results to the end users.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The intention is pretty simple - rump up the Rust knowledge, try telegram API and make a useful tool that can enhance daily routine's ease and immutability. The name of project was enherited right from the purpose - this bot is aimed to periodically notify (_congratulate_) participants about their results.

&nbsp; &nbsp; This Bot is built on [teloxide](https://github.com/teloxide/teloxide) and uses async [rust-tokio](https://tokio.rs) runtime. For the deplyoment platform, i've selected [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
